# Epic Cakes Website

This website aims to attract potential customers and baking enthusiasts who want to purchase a cake, buy baking equipment and/or find inspiration
and learn new skills.

The main aim of the website is to advertise bespoke cakes and baking equipment to a wider audience and provide enough options that they will find
something they like enough to follow the process through to the order form. The cake market is quite saturated so the UX will have to be
image-driven and easy to navigate, with minimal steps to the order form, which are as clear and easy to follow as possible in order to retain
customer interest.

### Design

#### Strategy

The aim of this website was to create a website that brings together a baking community, showcases the cakes and allows customers to buy baking
equipment all in one place, whilst mainly using images so that the design remains as minimal and user-friendly as possible.

#### Scope

Customers can scroll through a gallery of cakes to find the cake they would like to purchase and then click on that cake for a larger image
and to see the order options. They can also watch a video tutorial to learn baking skills, learn more about the company, purchase baking equipment,
visit the company's social media pages or contact the company if they wish to.

  tutorials.

- Customer Favourites: A selection of the company's bestselling cakes.
